            <p><b>Edgar Allan Poe</b>: Best known for his poems and short fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, born in Boston, Jan.
                19,
                1809,
                died Oct. 7, 1849 in Baltimore, deserves more credit than any other writer for the transformation of the
                short
                story from anecdote to art. He virtually created the detective story and perfected the psychological
                thriller.
                He also produced some of the most influential literary criticism of his time -- important theoretical
                statements
                on poetry and the short story -- and has had a worldwide influence on literature.</p>
            <p>
                He was born as Edgar Poe in Boston, Massachusetts; his parents died when he was young. Poe was taken in
                by
                John
                and Frances Allan, of Richmond, Virginia, but they never formally adopted him. After spending a short
                period
                at
                the University of Virginia and briefly attempting a military career, Poe parted ways with the Allans.
                Poe's
                publishing career began humbly, with an anonymous collection of poems, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827),
                credited only to "a Bostonian".</p>
